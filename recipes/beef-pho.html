    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Beef bones and tough beef cuts</li>
      <li>Flat rice noodles</li>
      <li>Aromatics: ginger and onion</li>
      <li>Spices: star anise, cinnamon/cassia sticks, and clove</li>
      <li>Salt, sugar, and fish sauce</li>
      <li>Steak</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
      <li>
        Make broth: Place beef bones in a 9-quart (or larger) pot; season with 1 teaspoon salt. Pour water into the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer broth for about 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a 10x15-inch roasting pan with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place onions and unpeeled ginger onto the prepared roasting pan and cook under the preheated broiler, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are charred, 10 to 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cool slightly. Chop onions, then peel and slice ginger; set aside separately.
      </li>
      <li>
        Skim fat from surface of simmering broth. Add oxtail, radish, and charred onions to broth. Tie charred ginger, anise, cinnamon stick, peppercorns, and cloves in cheesecloth to make a bouquet garni; add to broth. Stir in sugar, fish sauce, and remaining 2 teaspoons salt. Simmer over medium-low heat for at least 4 hours (the longer, the better). Season with salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Strain broth. Discard bones and bouquet garni. Reserve meat from bones for another use. Chill broth in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Skim and discard fat from the top of chilled broth. Pour broth into a pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and keep hot until ready to serve.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a pot of water to a boil. Turn off heat. Stir in rice noodles and let sit until noodles are tender yet chewy, 6 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Meanwhile, cut frozen sirloin into paper-thin slices.</li>
      <li>
        Drain and divide noodles among bowls, about 1 1/2 cups per serving. Top each with a few sirloin slices. Ladle hot broth over sirloin and noodles.
      </li>
      <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
